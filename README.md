# battlespire-tools
Tools for decoding battlespire files (and possibly other xl engine games)

bsatool will read anything pre-morrowind, but cant decompressed files from arena

bsitool mostly works but is missing some detail about colour

bs6tool dumps the level files to xml, i was using basex to pick them apart

3dtool dumps to .ply, don't remember if i got normals working but it's good enough that i've managed to import entire levels into blender
